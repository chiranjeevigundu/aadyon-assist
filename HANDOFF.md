# Handoff — the baton between agent sessions

This file is how Claude, Google Antigravity, and any other assistant hand work to each other.
Chat context does **not** transfer between tools; this file (plus [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
`git log`) is the shared memory. **A session that doesn't update this file didn't finish.**

Protocol: see "Working across assistants" in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Current state

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Everything merged & verified:** P2a Calendar Connector, Streaming Chat (SSE end-to-end), and the Schemathesis fuzzer fix (TaskStatus enum validation) have all been merged. UUID API typing was also fixed to prevent 500 errors.
- **Green baseline:** The `main` branch is clean, up-to-date, and all tests/CI are green.

## Next up

- **Next Goal:** The next open item on the ROADMAP is **Web dashboard login**.
- **Status:** Not started.
- **Next Steps:** Claude should create a new branch `feat/dashboard-login` and begin work on implementing token storage and 401 redirects in `dashboard/assets/base.js`.

## Known constraints for whoever picks this up

- Cloud sessions verify with `pytest` only (no Docker daemon / secrets); the compose smoke runs
  in CI. Don't claim smoke-level verification you couldn't run.
- The generic CRUD has no payload validation yet — that's why CI Schemathesis is GET-only
  (see the ROADMAP item before widening it).
- `code/db/seed/` is gitignored personal data on the owner's machines — never read or commit it.
