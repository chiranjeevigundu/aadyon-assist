# Handoff — the baton between agent sessions

This file is how Claude, Google Antigravity, and any other assistant hand work to each other.
Chat context does **not** transfer between tools; this file (plus [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
`git log`) is the shared memory. **A session that doesn't update this file didn't finish.**

Protocol: see "Working across assistants" in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Current state

- **Branch:** `fix/ci-uuid-lint` (PR open) — fixes the two failures that kept CI red on `main`
  after the P2–P4 merges: (1) `psycopg2.extras.register_uuid()` in `db/session.py` (the new
  Pydantic payload models emit `uuid.UUID` values psycopg2 couldn't adapt → 500s under
  Schemathesis write-fuzzing), (2) unused `get_settings` import in `routers/documents.py`
  (ruff F401 failed the Lint job).
- **Merged on `main`:** P2a Calendar, P2b Drive, P2c Banking connectors; P3 document analysis;
  P4 cloud storage (boto3 + CI mock); CRUD payload validation + full-surface Schemathesis;
  streaming chat (SSE end-to-end); web dashboard login.
- **Verified this session:** `pytest` 140 passed · `ruff check .` clean. CI on the PR is the
  smoke gate — confirm all four jobs green before merging.

## Next up

- Merge the `fix/ci-uuid-lint` PR once CI is green — `main` has been red since run #39.
- Then the top open ROADMAP items: P5 proactive intelligence (per-user ntfy topics + alert
  rules) and P5 voice (Expo STT/TTS over the existing chat endpoints).

## Known constraints for whoever picks this up

- Cloud sessions verify with `pytest` only (no Docker daemon / secrets); the compose smoke runs
  in CI. Don't claim smoke-level verification you couldn't run.
- Schemathesis now fuzzes ALL endpoints (writes included) — any new endpoint must never 5xx on
  bad input; map DB/validation errors to 4xx like `routers/crud.py` does.
- psycopg2 needs explicit adapters for non-primitive param types (UUID is registered in
  `db/session.py`; add others there if new typed columns appear).
- `code/db/seed/` is gitignored personal data on the owner's machines — never read or commit it.
