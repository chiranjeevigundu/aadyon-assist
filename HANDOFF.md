# Handoff — the baton between agent sessions

This file is how Claude, Google Antigravity, and any other assistant hand work to each other.
Chat context does **not** transfer between tools; this file (plus [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
`git log`) is the shared memory. **A session that doesn't update this file didn't finish.**

Protocol: see "Working across assistants" in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Current state

- **Branch:** `feat/dashboard-login`
- **Everything merged & verified:** P2a Calendar Connector, Streaming Chat (SSE end-to-end), and the Schemathesis fuzzer fix (TaskStatus enum validation) have all been merged to main.
- **Just Completed:** Web dashboard login. Implemented token storage via localStorage in `base.js`, added an `Authorization` header to a unified `fetchApi` wrapper, created a `/login` page, and refactored all existing dashboards (`/`, `/tracker`, `/data`, `/agency`, `/accounts`) to use `fetchApi` and handle 401 redirects. Tests pass. Code is pushed to `feat/dashboard-login` branch and is ready for PR and merge.

## Next up

- **Goal:** Dashboard login is complete and ready for review/merge.
- **Next Steps:** Proceed with the next priority (P4 — CRUD payload validation, or P2b — Drive connector) or review the PR!

## Known constraints for whoever picks this up

- Cloud sessions verify with `pytest` only (no Docker daemon / secrets); the compose smoke runs
  in CI. Don't claim smoke-level verification you couldn't run.
- The generic CRUD has no payload validation yet — that's why CI Schemathesis is GET-only
  (see the ROADMAP item before widening it).
- `code/db/seed/` is gitignored personal data on the owner's machines — never read or commit it.
